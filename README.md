# gozet

A second attempt at zettelkasten notes this time in golang. Golang is nice because its got great support for people who like CLI apps.

## Goals
 * Create a note from the cli. 
 * Pipe notes to to nvim. 
 * Write the note to the disk with its content as well as metadata. 
 * Use that content and metadata to link other notes. 
 * Convert content to HTML 
 * Convert markdown code blocks to good looking html code blocks
 * Publish to WWW using S3.
